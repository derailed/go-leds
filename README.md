# Go-leds

This repo hosts a simple web application to control RGB value on an LED strip.
The bot leverages the gobot library that exposes an api to control the RGB
values and control the strip using PWM pins.

The code is designed for an arduino board but can be easily ported to other
boards supporting PWM logic.
